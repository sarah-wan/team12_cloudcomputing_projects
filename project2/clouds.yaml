# This is a clouds.yaml file, which can be used by OpenStack tools as a source
# of configuration on how to connect to Chameleon.
#
# If you are only a member of one project, just put this file in
# ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml and tools like the CLI will just work with no
# further config. (You will need to add your password to the auth section)
#
# If you are a member of multiple projects, when invoking the CLI, provide
# either the env variable OS_CLOUD=<project> or flag --os-cloud=<project> to
# target your operation to the desired project, where <project> is the name
# (or nickname, if set) of your project.
